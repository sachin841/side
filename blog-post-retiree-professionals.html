                <p>Retirement means the end of your career, right? Wrong. For many, it's the beginning of a new, more flexible, and often more fulfilling chapter of earning. The biggest myth is that your professional life ends when you stop working 9-to-5. Retirement is not a passive state. It's an opportunity to work on your own terms, doing what you love, and getting paid for the lifetime of wisdom you've accumulated.</p>
                <p>This guide will show you how to leverage your decades of professional experience into profitable, low-stress side hustles that provide income, engagement, and a renewed sense of purpose.</p>

                <h2>Retirement as a Strategic Advantage</h2>
                <p>Retirees are uniquely positioned for side hustles. Your decades of experience, established networks, and accumulated wisdom are invaluable assets. You don't *need* a full-time income, which reduces pressure and allows you to choose projects you genuinely enjoy. Your career *is* your asset.</p>

                <h2>The "Experience Audit": Uncovering Your Hidden Gold</h2>
                <p>Before diving into specific hustles, take stock of your most valuable, marketable skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Competencies:</strong> What did you do every day? (e.g., Project management, financial analysis, writing reports, training staff, problem-solving).</li>
                    <li><strong>"Soft Skills":</strong> What made you good at your job? (e.g., Communication, leadership, mentoring, organization, attention to detail).</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry Knowledge:</strong> What specific insights do you have about your former industry? (e.g., "I know the ins and outs of the healthcare supply chain").</li>
                </ul>
