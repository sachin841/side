                <p>Life happens, and sometimes, you need cash fast. The frustration of waiting weeks for a paycheck can be a significant hurdle when unexpected expenses arise or you're simply trying to make ends meet. Many traditional jobs operate on bi-weekly or monthly pay cycles, leaving a gap for immediate financial needs.

                    <li><strong>Track Expenses:</strong> Keep a record of mileage, gas, and other costs, especially for gig economy jobs, for tax purposes.</li>
